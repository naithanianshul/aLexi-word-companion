                    While I was preparing for my GRE and IELTS, I was finding it hard to memorize and revise the words I encountered in different questions. 
                    I did refer to a book called 'Word Power Made Easy' by Norman Lewis and yes it worked wonders. It got me started on expanding my vocabulary. 
                    However, being from an engineering background, it was hard for me to just learn the advanced words for GRE. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Searching words on Google, Cambridge Dictionary and dictionary.com for every new and old word 
                    (yes, I often forgot the meaning of the word I had read after a significant period) became repetative, and well, boring! 
                </p>
                <p>
                    So, I built this application to keep things exciting and organized. The idea was to document every new word encountered with its meaning and 
                    sentence example. Also, I tried coalescing (yes, that means to amalgamate or combine) synonyms or related words together with the new word.
                    And along with the Word-Synonym-Network (I think WSN sounds cool) I also wanted to color-code the words based on their connotations - 
                    positive (Green), negative (Red) or neutral (Blue).
                </p>
                <p>
                    These are the very initial ideas from which this project started.
                    This approach worked for me, and I hope this project proves effective to everyone that uses this app!

                There are 3 main pages as you can see on the Navigation.
                <ul>
                    <li>Word Companion</li>
                    - This page lets you input words and their related information. You can also modify or remove the information of a specific word.
                    <li>Word Maps</li>
                    - You can search a word in the input field provided and look at its meaning and synonyms. This helps you to develop links and have a better understanding of the word.
                    <li>Flash Cards</li>
                    - Here you can put your current vocabulary to the test. Click on the card. It will show you the word. Try to guess its meaning. If you want a hint, just hover over the card and it'll show you its connotation.
                </ul>

                    How to build a Wordlist using Word Companion?

                    As you start your preparations, takes notes on words that you want to learn. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    In Word Companion, you must enter the <strong>word</strong> (obviously) along with its <strong>meaning</strong> (obviously), <strong>example</strong> (only if you want to be reminded how to use that word in a sentence), <strong>synonyms</strong> (only if you find other words that are similar or related to it) and its <strong>connotation</strong> (is the word positive, negative or neutral?)
                </p>
                <p>
                    This will help you to create a wordlist after your study sessions, and use your wordlist in Word Maps and Flash Cards!

            <div class="aboutAns collapse" id="aboutAns4" data-bs-parent="#about-accordion">
                <p>
                    There is only 1 input and 1 search button in Word Maps. Enter the word (from your wordlist) to study its related words.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Inside the display box, the word you searched for will appear in large bolds and will be highlighted as per its connotation. The meaning will appear right next to the highlighted word. The synonyms which are mentioned for the word will appear in the first cluster. The synonyms of the synonyms will appear in the second cluster (and synonyms of the synonyms of the synonyms.. you get the point).

                <p>
                    When you open the Flash Cards page you will see a button that looks literally like a card. When you click on it, the first word will appear. If you don't know its meaning, hover over the card and it will tell you about the word's connotation. If you still can't guess its meaning, just click on the card again and the meaning along with the word will appear in the table.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Repeat this until you master you master your entire wordlist.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Keep challenging yourself!

                    I actually do plan to develope more features and flexibility in aLexi.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Words as links in Word Maps</li>
                        - The Related Words displayed in Word Maps would be links if the data of that related word word exists.
                        <li>More color-coding options for connotations</li>
                        - The user will have an option to select different color-coding sets like 
                            <ul>
                                <li>Red - Blue - Green (3 differentiators)</li>
                                <li>Red - Yellow - Green (3 differentiators)</li>
                                <li>DarkRed - LightRed - Yellow - LightGreen - DarkGreen (5 differentiators)</li>
                            </ul>
                        <li>A Word of the day flashcard from your Wordlist</li>
                        - Once you have significant words in your Wordlist, a 'Word of the day' Flashcard will be displayed on your Home.
                        <li>Saving Wordlists as a document file</li>
                        - If you want to take the Wordlist offline, you can. Convinient isn't it?
                        <li>Sharing Wordlists</li>
                        - Wouldn't it be nice if instead of creating your Wordlist from 0, you start with someone's previously made Wordlist
                        and develope your own? Or maybe someone already has made a Wordlist specifically for GRE, IELTS or TOEFL?
                        It surely is a great idea to use that and built upon it as per your own personality and learning style.
                    </ul>
                    Change the color-coding, add, delete or modify the words, and make it personal.
                    Everybody's mind map works on different colour schemes right?
