                    While I was preparing for my GRE and IELTS, I was finding it hard to memorize and revise the words I encountered in different questions. 
                    I did refer to a book called 'Word Power Made Easy' by Norman Lewis and yes it worked wonders. It got me started on expanding my vocabulary. 
                    However, being from an engineering background, it was hard for me to just learn the advanced words for GRE. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Searching words on Google, Cambridge Dictionary and dictionary.com for every new and old word 
                    (yes, I often forgot the meaning of the word I had read after a significant period) became repetative, and well, boring! 
                </p>
                <p>
                    So, I built this application to keep things exciting and organized. The idea was to document every new word encountered with its meaning and 
                    sentence example. Also, I tried coalescing (yes, that means to amalgamate or combine) synonyms or related words together with the new word.
                    And along with the Word-Synonym-Network (I think WSN sounds cool) I also wanted to color-code the words based on their connotations - 
                    positive (Green), negative (Red) or neutral (Blue).
                </p>
                <p>
                    These are the very initial ideas from which is project started.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This approach worked really good for me, and I really hope this project proves effective to everyone that uses this app!

                    I actually do plan to develope more features and flexibility in aLexi.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Word-Links</li>
                        - The Related Words displayed after a Word search would be links if the definition of that related word word exists.
                        <li>More color-coding options for connotations</li>
                        - The user will have an option to select different color-coding sets like 
                            <ul>
                                <li>Red - Blue - Green (3 differentiators)</li>
                                <li>Red - Yellow - Green (3 differentiators)</li>
                                <li>DarkRed - LightRed - Yellow - LightGreen - DarkGreen (5 differentiators)</li>
                            </ul>
                        <li>A Word of the day flashcard from your Wordlist</li>
                        - Once you have significant words in your Wordlist, a 'Word of the day' Flashcard will be displayed on your Home.
                        <li>Saving Wordlists as an Excel or PDF file</li>
                        - If you want to take the Wordlist offline, you can. Convinient isn't it?
                        <li>Sharing Wordlists</li>
                        - Wouldn't it be nice if instead of creating your Wordlist from 0, you start with someone's previously made Wordlist
                        and develope your own? Or maybe someone already has made a Wordlist specifically for GRE, IELTS or TOEFL?
                        It surely is a great idea to use that and built upon it as per your own personality and learning style.
                        Change the color-coding, add, delete or modify the words, and make it personal.
                        Everybody's mind map works on different colour schemes right?
                    </ul>
